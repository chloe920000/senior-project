I'd rate the prompt an 85 out of 99.

The prompt is clear and specific, providing essential information about XYZ Inc. (2330) that a stock analyst would need to make predictions. The additional context requested is also relevant, as it allows for a more comprehensive analysis.

However, I deduct points because the prompt does not specify the time frame for the market trends or provide any historical data on XYZ Inc.'s performance. This could limit the analyst's ability to accurately forecast future stock prices.

Here are some recommendations to make the prompt even more precise:

1. Add specific details about the time frame for the market trends (e.g., "next quarter," "upcoming six months").
2. Include historical data on XYZ Inc.'s performance, such as its growth rate over the past year or five years.
3. Specify the industry and sector in which XYZ Inc. operates, as this could impact the company's stock price.

Assuming I am a stock analyst, my answers to the questions would be:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months?: Bullish
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/- 5%?: 2350 NTD
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 10%?: 2500 NTD
4. Recommended holding period for this investment? (months): 12 months
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy? What would be your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Trigger a sell order if the stock price falls by 7% or more from the buying price, or if the company's quarterly earnings miss expectations by 10% or more.
I'd rate the stock prediction prompt as 60 out of 99. The prompt provides some relevant data points, such as current price, BPS, capital, and ROE, which can be useful in evaluating the company's financial performance. However, it lacks specific information about the industry trends, market conditions, and competitive landscape, which are crucial factors that can influence a stock's price movement.

To make the prompt more precise, I would recommend adding the following details:

1. Industry trends: Provide an overview of the company's industry, including any relevant news, developments, or regulatory changes that could impact its performance.
2. Market conditions: Offer insights into broader market trends, such as economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth rate, inflation rate), interest rates, and market sentiment (e.g., whether it's a bull or bear market).
3. Competitive landscape: Provide information about the company's competitors, including their financial performance, market share, and any strategic moves that could impact XYZ Inc.
4. Valuation metrics: Include additional valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, and debt-to-equity ratio, to help evaluate the stock's value.

With these additional details, I would revise my evaluation score to 80 out of 99.

Here are my answers based on the original prompt:

I'll evaluate the prompt and provide a score along with recommendations to make it more precise.

**Score: 60**

The prompt provides some relevant information about the company, such as BPS, capital, and ROE. However, there is limited context about the company, industry, and market trends, which makes it difficult to provide accurate predictions. Additionally, the criteria for evaluation are somewhat vague, making it challenging to determine the recommended prices and holding period.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Provide more context**: Include information about the company's products or services, management team, financial health, industry trends, and market conditions. This will help analysts better understand the stock's potential.
2. **Be specific about market trends**: Clarify whether the analyst is predicting a trend based on current market conditions (e.g., bull/bear market) or a specific event-driven scenario (e.g., merger, new product launch).
3. **Define the margin of error**: Specify what percentage of error the recommended buying price should have to ensure a more accurate prediction.
4. ** Clarify stop-loss strategy criteria**: Provide more details about the criteria for triggering a sell order, such as a specific percentage decline or a technical indicator signal.

**Revised Score: 80**

With the revised prompt, I've increased the score to 80, as it now provides more context and specific details about the market trends and stop-loss strategy. This should help analysts provide more accurate predictions.
I'd rate the prompt an 85 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:
1. The prompt provides essential information about the company, including its current price, book value per share, capital, and return on equity.
2. It offers a clear set of criteria for evaluating the stock's performance over the next six months.

Weaknesses:

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Add specific information about the industry and market trends to provide more context for your evaluation.
2. Clarify the relationship between questions 3-5 and the bullish/bearish criteria. For example, you could specify that if the market is expected to be bearish, questions 2-4 will not be applicable.

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months?: Bullish
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/- 5%?: 2330 - 116 NTD (assuming a 5% decrease)
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 10%?: 2563.90 NTD (assuming a 10% increase from the buying price)
4. Recommended holding period for this investment? (months): 6 months
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy? What would be your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Sell if the stock price falls by 8% or more from the buying price, indicating a significant decline in value.
Score: 65
