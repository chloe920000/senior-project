Assuming you are a stock analyst, please conduct a long-term (over 12 months) prediction analysis and answer the following questions (only answer the following questions, do not give recommendations or analysis):

1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment? (at least 12 months)
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.

Evaluation criteria:

* A "bullish" market is defined as a stock price increase of at least 10% over the next one year, but avoid being overly conservative; consider the potential for a stronger performance if indicators suggest growth.
* A "bearish" market is defined as a stock price decline of at least 15% over the next one year, but ensure that a reasonable margin for error is accounted for, especially if the stock has stable fundamentals.
* If bullish, the selling price will usually be higher than the buying price, but aim for a balanced target that captures potential gains without excessive risk.
* If it is bearish, no need to answer question 2.3.4.5.
* It is recommended that the selling price should be the take profit price when bullish. If the former is bearish, you can skip it directly.

When evaluating, consider the possibility of moderate optimism based on positive trends, but balance this with realistic assessments of market risks.
