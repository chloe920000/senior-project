Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?: [bullish]
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: [Yes]
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: [84] NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: [24] months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: [20% decline from current price]
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: 

Reason: The company's ROE and ROA have been steadily increasing over the past 5 years, indicating a strong financial performance. The P/E ratio has also been decreasing, suggesting that investors are becoming more optimistic about the company's prospects. Additionally, the gross profit margin and OPM have been consistently high, indicating a strong operating performance. However, the debt-to-asset ratio is still relatively high, which may pose some risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, I believe that the company has a good chance of continuing its positive trend over the next one year, making it a bullish investment opportunity.
