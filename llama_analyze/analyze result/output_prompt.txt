I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 100. Here's why:

Strengths:

1. The prompt provides specific data points (current price, BPS, capital, ROE) that can be used to analyze the company.
2. It asks for a detailed analysis and justification for each answer, which ensures that the response will be thorough and well-supported.
3. The criteria for evaluating market trends are clearly defined, making it easier for the analyst to provide accurate answers.

Weaknesses:

1. The prompt could benefit from additional context about the company's industry, market trends, and competitors. This information would help to better understand the company's strengths and weaknesses.
2. There is no specific guidance on how to use the data points (BPS, capital, ROE) in the analysis. Providing more context or specific questions related to these metrics would be helpful.

Recommendations:

1. Add a section asking for additional context about the company, industry, and market trends. This could include information such as:
	* Industry-specific challenges or opportunities
	* Market trends and outlook
	* Competitors' performance
	* Regulatory environment
2. Provide more specific questions related to the data points (BPS, capital, ROE). For example:
	* How does the BPS compare to industry averages?
	* What is the implication of the high ROE on the company's stock price?
3. Consider adding a section asking for any assumptions or limitations in the analysis. This would help to acknowledge potential biases and provide a more nuanced view.
4. Provide more guidance on how to use the provided data points in the analysis. For example:
	* How does the current price relate to the BPS and capital?
	* What is the implication of the high ROE on the company's future performance?

By addressing these weaknesses, the prompt can be even more effective at eliciting a detailed and well-supported analysis from the analyst.
I would rate this prompt an 85 out of 99, as it provides a clear set of instructions and specific criteria for evaluation. However, there are some areas that could be improved upon to make the prompt more precise:

1. **Clarity**: The prompt is generally easy to understand, but some sections could be rephrased for better clarity. For example, the definition of "bullish" and "bearish" markets could be merged into a single sentence.
2. **Specificity**: While the prompt provides specific data points (e.g., current price, BPS, capital, ROE), it would be helpful to know more about the company's industry, market trends, and competitive landscape.
3. **Assumptions**: The prompt assumes that the analyst is aware of the company's financials and industry context. It would be beneficial to provide more background information or specific data points related to these factors.

To make this prompt more precise, I recommend the following changes:

1. Add a brief summary of the company's industry, market trends, and competitive landscape.
2. Provide additional context on the company's financials, such as revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow.
3. Clarify any assumptions made in the evaluation (e.g., what is considered a "good" or "bad" ROE for this industry?).
4. Consider adding more specific criteria for evaluating the stock's performance (e.g., what are the key metrics to watch for short-term vs. long-term growth?).

Here is an updated version of the prompt:

"Evaluate the stock price of XYZ Inc. (2330) based on the following data:

* Current price: 960
* BPS (book value per share): 133.38
* Capital: 2593
* ROE (return on equity): 26%

Additional context:

XYZ Inc. operates in the [industry], a rapidly growing sector with increasing demand for [products/services]. The company faces competition from [major competitors] and has a strong presence in [key markets].

Assume you are a stock analyst, provide answers to the following questions:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months?
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/- 10%?
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 15%?
4. Recommended holding period for this investment?
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy?

Criteria for evaluation:

* A "bullish" market is defined as an increase of at least 8% in the stock's price over the next six months.
* A "bearish" market is defined as a decrease of at least 12% in the stock's price over the next six months.

Please provide a detailed analysis and justification for your answers based on the provided data, company context, and specified criteria."
I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 100. It's well-structured, provides necessary context, and clearly outlines the expectations. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make it even more precise:

1. **Specificity**: While the prompt mentions additional context about the company, industry, and market trends, it would be helpful to provide specific guidance on what kind of information is expected (e.g., recent news, sector performance, economic indicators).
2. **Assumptions**: The assumption that a 10% margin of error for buying and 15% maximum loss for selling are reasonable may not hold true for all investors. Consider providing more flexibility or allowing the analyst to specify their own assumptions.
3. **Interpretation**: While the criteria for evaluating bullish/bearish markets are clearly defined, it would be helpful to provide guidance on how to interpret other aspects of the analysis (e.g., what constitutes a "good" holding period or stop-loss strategy).

To further refine this prompt, consider adding the following details:

* **Industry/market context**: Provide specific information about the industry XYZ Inc. operates in and any relevant market trends or news.
* **Investor profile**: Offer guidance on the type of investor the analysis is intended for (e.g., conservative, aggressive, long-term).
* **Analysis scope**: Clarify whether the analysis should focus on fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or a combination of both.

I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:

1. The prompt provides specific data points about XYZ Inc., which is essential for making informed predictions.
2. It outlines clear criteria for evaluating the market trend, which helps analysts focus their analysis.
3. The questions are well-defined and cover various aspects of stock evaluation.

Weaknesses:

1. The prompt assumes a high level of familiarity with financial concepts, such as book value per share (BPS), return on equity (ROE), and margin of error. A brief explanation or definition for these terms would be helpful.

Recommendations to make it more precise:

1. Add a brief introduction to financial concepts: Consider including a short paragraph explaining BPS, ROE, and margin of error. This would help non-experts understand the context.
2. Provide more external context: Include information about the industry XYZ Inc. operates in, any notable market trends or news that might impact the stock price, and the company's current financial performance (e.g., revenue growth, profitability).
3. Clarify the analysis scope: Specify whether the evaluation should focus on a specific aspect of the company's performance, such as its product lineup or management team.
4. Consider adding more questions: You could include additional questions to encourage analysts to think critically about the stock, such as:
	* What are the primary drivers of XYZ Inc.'s profitability?
	* How does the company's competitive landscape impact its financial performance?
	* Are there any potential risks or challenges that could affect the stock price?

By addressing these suggestions, you can make the prompt more comprehensive and challenging for analysts to provide a detailed and informed analysis.

2. Consider adding additional data points or metrics:
	* Revenue growth rate: This could provide insight into the company's underlying business performance.
	* Dividend yield: This could be an important consideration for income investors.
	* Valuation ratios (P/E, P/B): These could help analysts assess the stock's relative value.
3. Clarify the scope and assumptions:
	* Specify any implicit assumptions about the market or economy that should inform the analysis.
	* Consider adding a "what-if" scenario to test the analyst's thinking against alternative scenarios.

I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:

1. Clear goals: The prompt clearly outlines what the analyst needs to evaluate (the stock price of XYZ Inc.) and what specific questions to answer.
2. Relevant data provided: The given data points, such as current price, BPS, capital, and ROE, are relevant and useful for making a prediction.
3. Contextual information requested: The prompt asks for additional context about the company, industry, and market trends, which is essential for a thorough analysis.

Weaknesses:

1. Limited scope: The evaluation is limited to a single stock (XYZ Inc.) and does not consider broader market or sector trends.
2. Overemphasis on specific criteria: While the provided criteria are helpful, they might be too rigid, as stock price movements can be unpredictable and subject to various factors.

Recommendations for making it more precise:

1. Add more context: Request additional data points, such as revenue growth rate, debt-to-equity ratio, or industry-specific metrics, to provide a more comprehensive view of the company's financial performance.
2. Incorporate broader market insights: Ask for information about the overall market trends, sector performance, and economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, GDP growth) to better understand how they might impact XYZ Inc.'s stock price.
3. Clarify assumptions: Specify whether any underlying assumptions are being made (e.g., no major regulatory changes or industry disruptions).
4. Provide more context on the company's financial performance: Request additional information about XYZ Inc.'s financial statements, such as income statement and cash flow analysis, to better understand its profitability, cash generation, and capital structure.
5. Consider alternative scenarios: Instead of focusing solely on a bullish or bearish market, ask the analyst to consider multiple scenarios (e.g., stable, declining, or rising) to provide more nuanced predictions.

By incorporating these recommendations, you can make the prompt even more precise and challenging for the analyst to evaluate the stock price of XYZ Inc.
Score: 85

The prompt provides a good foundation for evaluating XYZ Inc.'s stock performance, with a clear set of metrics (BPS, capital, ROE) and specific criteria for determining bullish or bearish trends. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make the prediction more precise:

Recommendations:

1. **Add more context**: While providing information about the company, industry, and market trends is a good start, it would be helpful to specify which sectors, indices, or major events (e.g., economic indicators, interest rates) are relevant for XYZ Inc.
2. **Define margin of error**: Clarify how the +/- 10% margin of error will be applied when recommending buying prices. Will this be based on historical volatility, analyst consensus estimates, or another metric?
3. **Provide more guidance on stop-loss strategy**: While mentioning a maximum loss of 15%, it would be helpful to specify whether this is a trailing stop-loss (e.g., 15% below the current price) or a fixed percentage stop-loss (e.g., 15% from the original purchase price).
4. **Consider alternative scenarios**: Provide an analysis of potential bearish or bullish scenarios beyond the specified criteria (8% increase/decrease). This would demonstrate an understanding of the stock's dynamics and potential for unexpected events.
5. **Quantify assumptions**: When making predictions, it would be helpful to quantify the assumptions behind them (e.g., "I assume a 2-3% increase in ROE will lead to a 10% increase in stock price").

By addressing these areas, you can provide a more comprehensive and precise analysis of XYZ Inc.'s stock performance.
I'd give this prompt a score of 85 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:

* The prompt provides specific, relevant data points (current price, BPS, capital, ROE) that can be used to evaluate the stock.
* It asks for additional context about the company, industry, and market trends, which is important for making a informed analysis.
* The criteria for evaluating the market trend as bullish or bearish are clearly defined.

Weaknesses:

* The prompt is somewhat vague in its request for "additional context." It would be helpful to specify what types of information would be most relevant (e.g. recent news, industry trends, company performance).
* There is no clear guidance on how the analyst should use the provided data points to make predictions.
* Some of the questions (e.g. 2-5) may require subjective judgment or opinion, which can make it difficult for an AI system to provide a definitive answer.

Recommendations:

1. To make the prompt more precise, consider adding specific requirements for the additional context (e.g. "Please provide information about the company's recent financial performance, industry trends, and market news that may impact the stock price").
2. Consider providing more guidance on how to use the provided data points to make predictions. For example, you could ask the analyst to calculate certain ratios or metrics based on the BPS, capital, and ROE.
3. To make the prompt more objective, consider rephrasing questions 2-5 to focus more on specific calculations or analyses rather than subjective opinions.

Here's an updated version of the prompt that incorporates these recommendations:

* BPS (book value per share): 133.38
* Capital: 2593
* ROE (return on equity): 26%

Please provide additional context about the company, including its recent financial performance and any relevant industry trends or market news.

Using the provided data points, calculate the following metrics:

* Price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio)
* Return on assets (ROA)

Based on your analysis, answer the following questions:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months?
2. Calculate a recommended buying price based on a margin of error of +/- 10%.
3. Calculate a recommended selling price assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 15%.
4. Suggest a holding period for this investment based on your analysis.

Please provide a detailed analysis and justification for your answers based on the provided data and specified criteria."
I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 99, considering it provides a clear context, specific requirements, and well-defined evaluation criteria. However, there are some areas that can be improved to make it more precise and effective:

1. **Specificity**: While the provided data is relevant, it would be helpful to know more about the industry and market trends in which XYZ Inc. operates. This information will help provide a more nuanced analysis.
2. **Assumptions**: The prompt assumes that the stock analyst has access to all relevant information and can accurately forecast market movements. In reality, there are always uncertainties and risks involved in making predictions.
3. **Simplistic criteria**: The definition of a "bullish" or "bearish" market is overly simplistic. A more nuanced approach would consider factors like volatility, momentum, and technical indicators to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

To make this prompt more precise, I recommend the following revisions:

1. **Add industry and market context**: Include information about the company's sector, its position in the market, and any relevant trends or news that may impact its stock price.
2. **Refine assumptions**: Acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in making predictions and provide guidance on how to adjust for potential risks and biases.
3. **Use more sophisticated criteria**: Instead of relying solely on percentage changes, consider incorporating technical indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, or moving averages to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

I'll evaluate the prompt and provide a score along with recommendations for making it more precise.

**Score: 85**

The prompt provides sufficient information for a stock analyst to make predictions, including financial data (BPS, capital, ROE) and specific market trend definitions. However, the prompt could be improved by providing additional context about the company's recent performance, industry trends, and broader market conditions.

**Recommendations for making it more precise:**

1. **Add more context**: Include information about XYZ Inc.'s recent financial performance (e.g., revenue growth, profitability), its position in the industry (e.g., market share, competitors), and broader market trends (e.g., economic indicators, sector performance).
2. **Define additional criteria**: Provide additional guidelines or criteria for evaluating the stock's performance, such as a target P/E ratio or a specific dividend yield.
3. **Specify time frame**: Clarify whether the predictions are based on a specific time horizon (e.g., short-term, medium-term) and how this affects the analysis.
4. **Include more data**: Consider adding additional financial metrics, such as earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth rate, or dividend payout ratio, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the company's performance.
5. **Provide examples or scenarios**: Offer specific examples or scenarios that demonstrate how the analyst would apply the criteria and make predictions based on different market conditions.

By incorporating these suggestions, the prompt can become even more precise and informative for the stock analyst, allowing them to make more informed predictions and provide a more comprehensive analysis.

I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 100. Here's why:

Strengths:

1. The prompt provides specific data points about the company, which is great.
2. It outlines clear evaluation criteria for a bullish or bearish market.
3. The questions asked are relevant and align with common stock analysis tasks.

Weaknesses:

1. The prompt doesn't specify what kind of industry XYZ Inc. operates in, which could be important context.
2. The time frame for the prediction is relatively short (six months), which might limit the accuracy of the prediction.
3. Some questions may require subjective judgment or assumptions about market trends.

Recommendations to make it more precise:

1. Add specific industry information: Provide more context about XYZ Inc.'s industry, such as its competitive landscape, growth prospects, and regulatory environment.
2. Define additional metrics: Consider adding other relevant financial metrics, such as revenue growth rate, profit margin, or debt-to-equity ratio, to provide a more comprehensive view of the company's performance.

Please provide a detailed analysis and justification for your answers based on the provided data and the specified criteria."
I'd rate the prompt an 85 out of 99. The prompt is clear and specific, providing all necessary information for evaluation. However, I would suggest a few minor improvements to make it even more precise:

1. Define what constitutes "additional context" about the company, industry, and market trends. This could include specific metrics or data points that will influence your analysis.
2. Clarify whether any additional assumptions are being made beyond those listed in the criteria section (e.g., do you assume a constant dividend yield or no major changes in the company's financials)?
3. Consider providing more guidance on how to interpret and prioritize the provided data (e.g., which metrics should be given more weight when evaluating the stock price)?

With these minor tweaks, I'd revise my rating to 95 out of 99.

The remaining 4% is due to a slight ambiguity in the criteria section regarding the recommended selling price when the prediction is bearish.
I'd rate the prompt a 70 out of 99, as it provides a clear framework for evaluating the stock price of XYZ Inc. and includes relevant context about the company, industry, and market trends. However, I would suggest making it more precise by adding specific requirements for each question, such as:

1. Providing additional data points (e.g., revenue growth rate, profitability ratios) to support the analysis.
2. Clarifying the criteria for determining bullish or bearish trends (e.g., percentage increase/decrease from current price).
3. Specifying the margin of error for the recommended buying price and stop-loss strategy.

Here are my suggestions:

1. Add specific requirements for evaluating the stock's performance, such as:
	* Define what constitutes a "bullish" market (e.g., 10% increase in stock price over six months) and a "bearish" market (e.g., 15% decrease).
	* Specify the time frame for analyzing market trends (e.g., last quarter, year-to-date).
2. Clarify the criteria for determining the recommended buying price:
	* Provide specific guidelines for calculating the margin of error (+/- 5%) and how it will be applied to determine the buying price.
3. Define the stop-loss strategy more clearly:
	* Specify what triggers a sell order (e.g., a 10% loss from the original purchase price) and provide an example of a trigger point.

With these suggestions, I would rate the prompt a score of 85-90 out of 99.
I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 100. It's well-structured, and the evaluation criteria are clearly defined. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make it more precise:

1. **Specificity**: While the prompt provides general guidelines for evaluating the stock price, it would be more effective if specific metrics were provided for each question. For example, what constitutes a "significant increase" or "substantial decrease" in the stock's price?
2. **Context**: While the prompt asks you to provide additional context about the company, industry, and market trends, it would be helpful to specify which specific factors should be considered (e.g., economic indicators, competitor performance, regulatory changes).
3. **Assumptions**: The prompt assumes that the analyst has access to the provided data (current price, BPS, capital, ROE). However, it's not clear what other assumptions are being made (e.g., market volatility, interest rates).

To make this prompt more precise, consider adding specific requirements for each question and providing additional context about the company and industry. This will help ensure that analysts provide more informed and accurate answers.

Please answer according to the example format, do not explain."

This revised prompt provides more specific requirements and considerations for each question, which should lead to more precise and accurate answers.
Score: 80

This prompt is well-structured and provides clear guidelines for the analyst to follow. However, there are a few areas that could be improved upon:

1. Provide more context about the company's financials and industry trends before asking the analyst to make predictions.
2. Consider adding more specific criteria for determining the bullish or bearish market, such as the current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) or dividend yield.
3. Define what is meant by "margin of error" in question 2.

Recommendations:

1. Add a section before the questions that provides an overview of XYZ Inc.'s financial performance, industry trends, and market conditions.
2. Consider adding more specific criteria for determining the bullish or bearish market, such as the current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) or dividend yield.
3. Define what is meant by "margin of error" in question 2.

Example format:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months?: Bullish
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/…: 123 NTD
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 10%?: 150 NTD
4. Recommended holding period for this investment? (months): 6 months
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy? What would be your criteria for triggering a sell order?: If the stock price falls by 8% from the buying price
I'd rate this stock prediction prompt an 85 out of 99.

Strengths:

* The prompt provides specific and relevant data points (BPS, capital, ROE) to inform the analysis.
* It asks the analyst to provide additional context about the company, industry, and market trends, which is essential for making a well-informed prediction.
* The criteria for evaluation are clearly defined, providing a clear framework for the analysis.

Weaknesses:

* The prompt could benefit from more specific guidance on how to use the provided data points. For example, what weight should be given to each metric in determining the stock's direction?
* There is no mention of any external factors that might influence the stock price, such as macroeconomic trends or regulatory changes.
* The stop-loss strategy criteria are not clearly defined. What specific triggers would prompt a sell order?

To make this prompt more precise, I'd suggest adding the following:

1. Provide more specific guidance on how to use the data points (e.g., what metrics have the greatest influence on stock price).
2. Add questions about external factors that might impact the stock price (e.g., macroeconomic trends, regulatory changes).
3. Define the stop-loss strategy criteria in more detail (e.g., what specific triggers would prompt a sell order).

With these additions, I'd rate the revised prompt a 95 out of 99!
I'd rate the prompt an 80 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:

1. The prompt provides specific guidelines and definitions for evaluating the stock, which helps to clarify expectations.
2. It asks the analyst to provide actionable recommendations (buying price, selling price, holding period) instead of just making predictions.

Weaknesses:

1. The prompt is quite lengthy and may intimidate some users or analysts.
2. Some sections, such as "Additional context about the company, industry, and market trends," are open-ended and could benefit from more specific guidance.

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Break up the prompt into smaller sections or sub-points to make it easier to read and understand.
2. Provide more specific guidance on what kind of additional context is desired (e.g., "Please provide a brief overview of XYZ Inc.'s recent financial performance, its position in the industry, and any relevant market trends").
3. Consider adding more clarity around the margin of error (+/- 5%) and maximum loss (10%) for questions 2-4.
4. To make the prompt even more precise, consider adding specific metrics or ratios that analysts should focus on when evaluating the stock (e.g., "Please use the following financial metrics: P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.").

Overall, this is a well-crafted prompt that provides a clear framework for evaluation and analysis. With some minor tweaks, it could be even more effective at eliciting precise and actionable recommendations from analysts.
I'd rate the prompt as 85 out of 99, with room for improvement in the following areas:

1. **Clarity**: The prompt is generally clear and concise, but some parts may benefit from rephrasing or additional context. For example, what exactly does "additional context about the company, industry, and market trends" entail?
2. **Specificity**: While the criteria for evaluation are clearly stated, it would be helpful to provide more specific guidance on how to interpret the input data (BPS, capital, ROE) in relation to the stock's price movement.
3. **Assumptions**: The prompt assumes that the analyst will use a margin of error of +/- 5% and a maximum loss of 10% for stop-loss strategy. It would be helpful to clarify these assumptions or provide alternative scenarios.

To make the prompt more precise, I'd suggest the following:

* Clarify what specific data points are required for evaluation (e.g., exact values for BPS, capital, ROE) and how they should be interpreted.
* Provide examples of what constitutes "additional context" about the company, industry, and market trends.
* Consider adding alternative scenarios or assumptions to accommodate different analyst approaches.

Here's an updated prompt that incorporates these suggestions:

"Evaluate the stock price of XYZ Inc. (2330) based on the following data:

     * Current price: [insert exact value]
     * BPS (book value per share): [insert exact value]
     * Capital: [insert exact value]
     * ROE (return on equity): [insert exact value]

Provide specific, concrete examples of additional context about the company, industry, and market trends.

Assume you are a stock analyst, provide answers to the following questions:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months? (Specify the criteria used for evaluation)
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/- [insert percentage]%?
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of [insert percentage]%?
4. Recommended holding period for this investment? (months)
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy? What would be your criteria for triggering a sell order?

Criteria for evaluation:

* A "bullish" market is defined as an increase of at least 10% in the stock's price over the next six months.
* A "bearish" market is defined as a decrease of at least 15% in the stock's price over the next six months.

Answer according to the example format, do not explain"

This revised prompt provides more specificity and clarity on what data points are required and how they should be interpreted. It also encourages the analyst to provide concrete examples of additional context and specifies the criteria for evaluation.
I'd rate this prompt an 85 out of 100, as it provides a clear framework for the stock prediction and includes relevant data points to inform the analysis. However, I'll offer some suggestions to make it more precise:

1. **Specificity**: While the prompt mentions "additional context" about the company, industry, and market trends, it would be helpful to specify what types of information are desired (e.g., recent news, financial reports, sector performance).
2. **Clarity on data usage**: The prompt assumes that the analyst will use the provided data points (BPS, capital, ROE) to inform their analysis. However, it's unclear whether these values should be used as inputs for a model or simply as context.
3. **Relevant market indicators**: Considering the stock's performance relative to broader market indices (e.g., TAIEX) could provide valuable insights.

To further refine the prompt, you might consider adding more specific questions or criteria for evaluation. For example:

* What are the key drivers of XYZ Inc.'s growth (or decline)?
* How does the company's financial health compare to its peers?
* Are there any industry-specific trends that could impact the stock's performance?

By incorporating these suggestions, you can create a more comprehensive and precise prompt that allows analysts to provide more informed and detailed responses.
I'd rate the prompt as 85 out of 99, with some minor suggestions to make it more precise and clear.

The strengths of this prompt are:

1. Clear objectives: The prompt outlines specific questions that need to be answered.
2. Specific evaluation criteria: The criteria for evaluating the stock's performance (bullish/bearish) are clearly defined.
3. Relevant data requirements: The prompt asks for relevant financial data, such as BPS, capital, and ROE.

To make this prompt even more precise and clear, I would suggest:

1. Clarify what specific time period is considered for the "next six months." Is it a calendar quarter (January to March), or a specific date range?
2. Define the margin of error for buying and selling prices. Is it +/- 5% absolute, or relative to the current price?
3. Provide more context about the company's industry and market trends. This would help analysts provide more informed answers.
4. Clarify the stop-loss strategy criteria for triggering a sell order. For example, what percentage decrease in stock price would trigger a sell order?

Here is an updated version of the prompt incorporating these suggestions:

"Evaluate the stock price of XYZ Inc. (2330) based on the following data:
	* Current price: 
	* BPS (book value per share): 
	* Capital: 
	* ROE (return on equity):

Provide additional context about the company, industry, and market trends.

Assume you are a stock analyst, provide answers to the following questions:

1. Will it be bullish or bearish in the next six months (calendar quarter January to March)? 
2. Recommended buying price, considering a margin of error of +/- 5% relative to the current price? NTD
3. Recommended selling price, assuming a stop-loss strategy with a maximum loss of 10% absolute? NTD
4. Recommended holding period for this investment? (months)
5. Suggested stop-loss strategy? What would be your criteria for triggering a sell order?

Criteria for evaluation:

* A "bullish" market is defined as an increase of at least 10% in the stock's price over the next six months.
* A "bearish" market is defined as a decrease of at least 15% in the stock's price over the next six months.
* If it is bullish, usually the selling price will be higher than the buying price. 
* If it is bearish, you do not need to answer question 2-5.

Answer according to the example format, do not explain"

With these minor adjustments, the prompt becomes more precise and clear, providing a better foundation for analysts to provide accurate answers.
I'd give this prompt a score of 85 out of 99. Here's why:

Strengths:

* The prompt provides clear instructions and defines specific criteria for evaluation.
* It asks the analyst to provide concrete answers, including numerical values and stop-loss strategies.
* The format is easy to follow, with each question having a clear answer expectation.

Weaknesses:

* The data provided is limited, consisting only of BPS, capital, ROE, and current price. Additional financial metrics or industry/market trends would be helpful in making a more informed prediction.
* There's no guidance on how to use the provided data to make predictions or what specific factors to consider when analyzing the company.
* The prompt doesn't provide any context about the analyst's perspective or their experience with similar stocks.

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Add more data points: Include other financial metrics, such as revenue growth rate, operating margin, and cash flow, to give a more comprehensive view of the company.
2. Provide context: Give the analyst some background information on XYZ Inc., including its industry, market trends, and recent performance.
3. Clarify evaluation criteria: While the prompt defines bullish and bearish conditions, it would be helpful to provide more specific guidance on how to apply these criteria to the analysis.
4. Consider adding additional questions: Ask follow-up questions that require the analyst to think critically about their predictions, such as "What are the key drivers of your prediction?" or "How does this stock compare to its peers?"

By addressing these areas, you can make the prompt more comprehensive and challenging for the analyst, while also providing a clearer understanding of how to evaluate the stock.
