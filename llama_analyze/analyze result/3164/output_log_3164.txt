2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 17 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 6 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Trigger a sell order when the stock price falls by 15% from the current price, or when the ROE and ROA indicators show a significant decline.
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's financial performance has been inconsistent over the past few years, with declining EPS and ROE/ROA indicators in some years. Additionally, the debt-to-asset ratio has increased in recent years, which may indicate a higher risk of default. These factors suggest that the stock price may decline in the next year due to these underlying issues.
