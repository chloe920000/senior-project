6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The ROE and EPS have been volatile in the past few years, with some negative values. The DBR has also been increasing steadily, which may indicate a higher risk of debt crisis. Additionally, the gross profit margin and OPM have not shown significant improvement over the past 5 years. These factors suggest that the company's financial health is uncertain, making it bearish for the next six months.
