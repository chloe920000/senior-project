2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No

5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Trigger a sell order if the stock price falls below 75% of its current value (11.25 NTD) or when the company's fundamentals show significant deterioration.
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's recent ROE and ROA have been negative, indicating poor profitability and asset utilization. Additionally, the high debt-to-asset ratio suggests a significant financial risk. While the gross profit margin has improved, the operating margin remains low, which may indicate underlying operational issues. These factors contribute to a bearish outlook for the company's stock price over the next year.
