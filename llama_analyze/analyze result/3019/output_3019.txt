6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's financial performance has been volatile over the past few years, with declining ROE and EPS in some periods.

Additionally, the stock price has already reached a relatively high level of 83 NTD, which may indicate that it is overvalued compared to its historical average.
