Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?: [bullish]
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: [Yes]
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: [25] NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: [24] months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: [Close price < 20 NTD, or EPS decrease by 15%]
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's ROE and ROA have shown signs of improvement in recent years, indicating potential growth. The gross profit margin and OPM are also increasing, suggesting a healthy business environment. However, the debt-to-asset ratio has been relatively high, which may pose some risks if not managed properly. Overall, I believe the company's positive trends outweigh its potential risks, making it a bullish investment opportunity.
