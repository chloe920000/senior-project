1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?: bullish
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: Yes
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 57 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 24 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Trigger sell order if ROE drops below 15% or EPS decreases by more than 20%
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's recent surge in EPS and ROE suggests strong growth potential, while the gross profit margin and OPM have also shown improvement, indicating a healthy business model. However, the DBR has increased, which might be a concern if not managed properly. Overall, I believe the positive trends outweigh the risks, making it a bullish investment.
