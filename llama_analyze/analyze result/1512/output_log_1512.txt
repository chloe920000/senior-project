6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's financial performance has been declining over the past few years, with negative ROE and ROA in recent years. The high debt-to-asset ratio (DBR) of over 70% also indicates a significant risk. Additionally, the EPS has been decreasing, which suggests that the company may not be able to generate sufficient profits to support its stock price.
