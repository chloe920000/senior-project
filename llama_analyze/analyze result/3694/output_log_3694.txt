Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?: Bearish
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 24 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 9 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Close below 23 NTD, or if ROE < 0, or if EPS < -1.
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's DBR has been increasing steadily over the past few years, which may indicate a high level of debt and potentially unsustainable financials. Additionally, the recent price increase seems to be driven by short-term market sentiment rather than fundamental improvements in the business.
