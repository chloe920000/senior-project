Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Is the next one year bullish or bearish?: bearish
2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 27 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 12 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Stop-loss triggered when the stock price falls by 15% from the current price.
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The ROE and ROA have been fluctuating, but the recent high EPS and low DBR suggest some stability. However, the P/E ratio has been dropping, indicating a possible decrease in investor confidence. Additionally, the Gross profit margin and OPM are relatively stable, which may not support significant growth. Overall, these factors suggest a bearish market for the next year.
