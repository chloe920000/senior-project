6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: I think it's bearish because the company's financial performance has been declining over the past few years, with decreasing EPS and ROE, and increasing debt-to-asset ratio. Additionally, the industry trend for TFT-LCD inspection machines has been slowing down, which may affect the company's revenue growth.
