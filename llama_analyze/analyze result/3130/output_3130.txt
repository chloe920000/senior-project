2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 114.43 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 12 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Sell when DBR > 45% or EPS < -0.8, or when the stock price falls by more than 15% from the current price.
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's ROE and ROA have been declining over the past few years, indicating potential financial difficulties. The high DBR ratio also suggests that the company may be taking on too much debt to finance its operations. Additionally, the stock price has been relatively stable in recent years, which could indicate a lack of growth momentum.
