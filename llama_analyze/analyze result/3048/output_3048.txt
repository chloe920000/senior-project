6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: Based on the company's stable financials, increasing EPS, and improving ROA and ROE, I expect the stock price to continue growing over the next year.

However, I am cautious about the high DBR ratio, which may limit the company's ability to invest in new projects and maintain its market share.
