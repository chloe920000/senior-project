5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Close below 9 NTD, or when ROE falls below -15%
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's declining BPS, capital, and EPS over the past 5 years indicate a weakening financial performance. Additionally, the high DBR ratio suggests significant debt burden, which may limit the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives. Furthermore, the decline in ROE and ROA over the past 2-3 years indicates a lack of profitability growth, making it difficult for the stock price to rebound.
