Here are the answers to the questions:

2. Based on the current price, is it recommended to buy?: No
3. Based on the current price, assuming the maximum loss of the stop loss strategy is 10%, what is the recommended selling price?: 16 NTD
4. What is the recommended holding period for this investment?: 24 months
5. Suggested stop loss strategy? What are your criteria for triggering a sell order?: Sell when price drops by 15% or ROE/ROA turns negative
6. Please give specific reasons why you think it is bullish or bearish.: The company's BPS has been declining over the past 5 years, and while EPS has shown some improvement in recent years, it remains relatively low compared to historical highs. Additionally, the DBR has decreased significantly from its peak, which may indicate a shift towards more debt financing, potentially increasing financial risk. Furthermore, the OPM is still negative, indicating operational challenges that need to be addressed.
